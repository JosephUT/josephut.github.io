## About Me

I am a current Masters student (2023 - 2025) and former B.S.E student (2020 - 2023) in robotics at the University of Michigan. I've briefly spent time in a number of robotics labs, but I am currently and most steadfastly a member of the Lab for Progress advised by Prof. Odest Chadwicke Jenkins.

## Interests

I'm interested in studying robotics at the system level. I'm particularly interested in creating systems where perception and action are tightly integrated but can be carefully analyzed. I'm also interested in infrastructure for deploying and maintaining these systems, including task specification, model-based pipelines, and data collection. Dynamical systems theory and control theory provide a rich language for analyzing the feedback that must exist between perception and action. However, rather than tracking a reference, robots demand the much more general goal of task completion. Deep learning is undoubtedly a vital tool for describing and acheiving this more abstract goal. As such, I'm invested in mastering and leveraging ideas from both worlds. My research interests are summarized below. 

- **Robotics:** Robust control, robust perception, imitation learning, self-supervised learning. 
- **Deep Learning:** Neural network analysis, deep generative modeling, representation learning.

More casually, I enjoy software engineering -- especially when it lets me learn more about the amazing computational infrastructure on which robots are built. I'm also passionate about robotics education. I was one of the first two to graduate from Michigan's undergraduate program in robotics, and benefitted from it immensely. During my time in the Lab for Progress I've met a few very special people who have both inspired me and enabled me to give back through contributions to open source courses. My professionally relevant non-research interests are summarized below. 

- **Software:** Robot middleware, ML compilers, Linux kernel development.
- **Education:** Undergraduate robotics education, open source course development.

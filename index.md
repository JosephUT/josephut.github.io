# About Me

I am a current Masters student (2023 - 2025) and former B.S.E student (2020 - 2023) in robotics at the University of Michigan advised by [Prof. Odest Chadwicke Jenkins](https://ocj.name){:target="_blank"} in the [Lab for PROGRESS](https://progress.eecs.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

## Interests

In the long run, I hope that the large scale deployment of autonomy will afford humans unprecedented control athority over the physical world and enable paradigm shifts in the ways we can address problems in energy, infrastructure, transportation, logistics, agriculture and many other sectors. Down the road -- when this hope feels closer to reality -- I want to spend my career working in specific niches where robotics can concretely contribute to solving major societal challenges. But I'm not there yet. And I'm not sure the field is either.

For the next several years, my focus is on **integration** as a core challenge to scalably deploying robotics in the open world. Particularly, I'm concerned with understanding when and how subsystems can cause each other to fail, leading to robots that are unreliable, unsafe, untrusted, and difficult to develop, deploy, and maintain. I'm interested in uncovering such failure modes of current systems empirically and drawing on ideas from geometric deep learning, neural network analysis, convex optimization, and control design to develop techniques to diagnose, rectify, and eliminate these failure modes at the design level. Additionally I'm interested in developing and contributing to software, especially middleware, that streamlines the application of such techniques on real systems.

While these problems are largely practical, I believe they are also deeply connected to fundamental tensions between artificial intelligence and control, which I see as the two viewpoints anchoring robotics. Recent methodology from artificial intelligence, for example vision-language-action foundation models and pixels-to-torques diffusion policies, have enabled massive improvements in the performance and generality of autonomous systems and provided an incredible level of integration across the high-level problems of perception, task planning, and motion planning. However the methods themselves and the underlying mechanisms are largely opaque to analysis and failures are difficult to diagnose or predict. Meanwhile control is centered around clear analysis, with a long history of success on real systems. But existing techniques lack the representational power to deal with high-level problems -- which are not physically grounded -- on their own. Certainly, this observation is not uniquely mine, and much of the current work in robotics seeks in some way to resolve this tension. I hope that by grounding *my* work in studying real failure modes at the interection of subsystems with integration as a guiding principle, I will be able to make some small and original contribution to this fundamental challenge.

A dual problem to the above is teaching robotics as a unified discipline. I've been incredibly fortunate to be involved with the release of the Robotics Department at Umich, especially its associated undergraduate program. Growing up in the shadow of so many [great roboticists at Michigan](https://robotics.umich.edu/people/faculty/){:target="_blank"} (and at [Amazon Robotics](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/amazon-robotics){:target="_blank"}) has been incredibly impactful and allowed me to develop a diverse background across problems that just don't get studied together anywhere else -- deep learning, computer vision, SLAM, control, estimation, optimization, algorithms, and middleware to name a few. This background lays a relatively clear path for me to start thinking about the tensions above, and making my own contributions. It will for other students too. That's why I'm so incredibly proud of my contributions to open source teaching under my advisor Prof. Jenkins. Robotics needs all the hands it can get. It shouldn't matter where you come from, or how long it takes you to get up to speed. While I've learned my lesson about over-committing to teaching and course development, those who know me understand when I say: "my office hours are long, but my patience for change is not".

Outside of robotics, I don't actively cultivate any interests. When I need a break you can find me lifting or playing soccer.

## Background

I spent the first year of my Masters primarily focused on teaching. I served as the first Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) of ROB 102 Intro to Programming and AI following its development and first two offerings under [Prof. Jana Pavlasek](https://janapavlasek.com/){:target="_blank"}, then a doctoral student of my advisor. I also led initial efforts to re-develop ROB 320 Robot Operating Systems (formerly EECS 367 Introduction to Autonomous Robotics), into a more rigorous and general course on robot middleware that leaves students better prepared for industry. Subsequently, I served as the GSI for a transitional offering of the course. I also briefly visited the [ROAHM Lab](https://www.roahmlab.com/){:target="_blank"} under [Prof. Ram Vasudevan](https://www.roahmlab.com/ram-personal){:target="_blank"} and [Anja Sheppard](https://anja-sheppard.github.io/){:target="_blank"} -- working on accelerated semantic mapping with OpenVDB -- and the [ARM Lab](https://arm.robotics.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"} under [Prof. Dmitry Berenson](https://berenson.robotics.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Tom Power](https://powertj.github.io/){:target="_blank"} -- working on performance engineering for [Constrained Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12110){:target="_blank"}. The multitude of commitments left me drained, so I took the following summer off to work through some of Tedrake's online material and more of Boyd's convex optimization book, develop a few changes for ROB 102, and re-center myself.

Before entering the Masters program I graduated in three years with highest honors from the robotics B.S.E. program as part of the inaugural class. I was also awarded the inaugural [departmental award for undergraduate academic achievement](https://robotics.umich.edu/2023/robotics-student-award-winners-of-2023/){:target="_blank"}. I was extremely fortunate to intern on the software team for [Proteus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUnZXBL_lqA){:target="_blank"} at Amazon Robotics for two consecutive summers. In summer 2022, I developed low angle marker pose estimation algorithms for downstream localization in a sister project with [Sharanya Venkat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharanya-venkat-aa5960178/){:target="_blank"} under mentorship from [Jaimie Carlson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaimie-carlson-55334b133/){:target="_blank"} and [Sadat Shaik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadat-shaik-415712126/){:target="_blank"}. In summer 2023, I delivered a mapping path generation system for optimizing downstream localization in fullfillment centers with [Shalin Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shalin-jain/){:target="_blank"} under mentorship from [Dr. Andreas Kolling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-kolling-phd-2767591/){:target="_blank"}, [Chris Keane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-keane-5a788548/){:target="_blank"} and [Sam Wen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianhongwen/){:target="_blank"}. The combined experience taught me so much about the real world of scaling robotics, and I think about what I learned there often. I also visited the [Field Robotics Group](https://fieldrobotics.engin.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"} under [Prof. Katie Skinner](https://fieldrobotics.engin.umich.edu/team){:target="_blank"}, [Advaith Sethuraman](https://www.advaiths.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Onur Bagoren](https://www.obagoren.com/){:target="_blank"} in a support role for an image-ultrasonic NeRF project. Critically, I served as an IA for ROB 102 and ROB 320, where I met my advisor. I spent the early years of college realizing the profound impact computing has had and will have on society, figuring out what I wanted to do with my life, and learning to code.

Before all that I attended [Morgantown High School](https://mohigans.mono.k12.wv.us/){:target="_blank"} in my home town in West Virginia, where I took way too many APs. I participated in FIRST robotics for nine years, starting with several FLL teams, and ending with working on the pit crew and as an outreach co-lead on the international hall of fame [FRC Team 2614 MARS](https://www.marsfirst.org/){:target="_blank"}. I cultivated a love of science competing in National Science Bowl in both middle school and high school. I played varsity soccer for four years and club soccer for eight years. I took art all the way through to AP studio and started playing piano in first grade. I also completed the Boy Scouts of America program with [Troop 65](https://troop65wv.org/){:target="_blank"} and spent most of my summers backpacking and doing trail work. I was homeschooled from first grade through eighth grade by a very overqualified teacher (my mom). In my earliest years I spent a little time doing math and a lot of time making stuff with LEGOs, doing art, and climbing trees.

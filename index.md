# About Me

I'm a current M.S. student (2023 - 2025) and former B.S.E student (2020 - 2023) in robotics at the University of Michigan advised by [Prof. Odest Chadwicke Jenkins](ocj.name) in the [Lab for PROGRESS]().

I'm interested in robotics because I believe it will have an unprecedented impact on society over the next several decades. I want to be

I believe in studying robotics holistically.

During my master's program thus far I've

I completed my undergrad in three years and was one of the first two students to earn a degree from the undergraduate program in robotics following the promotion of Umich's Robotics Institute to a full department. During my undergrad I interned at [Amazon Robotics](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/tag/robotics) on the software team for [Proteus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUnZXBL_lqA) and was awarded the [Distinguished Academic Acheivement Undergraduate Award](https://robotics.umich.edu/2023/robotics-student-award-winners-of-2023/#:~:text=Joseph%20Taylor&text=The%20Distinguished%20Academic%20Achievement%20Undergraduate,for%20success%20in%20future%20endeavors.) in the robotics department for academic performance, character, and dedication to student success in positions as an instructional assisstant under Prof. Jenkins. I decided to stay on for a master's and interned at Amazon again between programs.

Working at Amazon made me aware of fundamental gaps between the largely theoretical education I'd received and the system level understanding necessary for shipping production code on real robots. In a joint effort to fill in my own knowlege and push the undergraduate curriculum towards leaving future students more prepared, I spent most of the first year of my master's leading a team to develop a course on topics surrounding Linux system programming and robot middleware implementation and design under the oversight of Prof. Jenkins. The process was surprisingly challenging and involved everything from teaching myself operating systems and scouring man pages to testing custom RPC implementsions. Unfortunately, the first offering came up short and still left a lot of students underserved. After an academic year of working on the project it's been turned over to the next team, but I hope the work I put in motion will make students more prepared for industry. 

Although I learned a lot, the experience also overshadowed brief visits with the [ARM Lab]() under [Prof. Dmitry Berenson]() and the [ROAHM Lab]() under [Prof. Ram Vasudevan]().  and I'm moving on to focus on research for the remainder of my program.

These days I don't spend much time on anything outside of robotics. When I need a break, I enjoy weightlifting, soccer, and ultimate. When I had more time and lived back home in West Virginia, I loved outdoor sports, especially backpacking, rock climbing, and whitewater kayaking. I used to do a lot of visual art too, so maybe I'll pick that up again some day.

This is a curated list of robotics projects I've done during my time at Umich. Some are personal projects, some were done as open-ended projects for course credit. I've excluded the many projects I've worked on which were guided course projects. I'll briefly list theory I had to learn and technical skills I had to develop or use for each project.

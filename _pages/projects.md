This is a curated list of robotics projects I've completed during my time at Umich. I make as much of my work from these projects available as I can. Hopefully they demonstrate my technical ability accurately.

## Open-Ended Projects
These are projects I've completed either on my own, or as part of an open-ended project with some advising. These are more advanced and mostly more recent projects. 

- Lie Theoretic Estimation, Control, and Planning on Symmetric Systems
- Hardware Accelerated Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization
- MRM: A Minimal Robot Middleware Package in C++ and Rust
- LQR and Nonlinear MPC on a Ballbot in Simulation

## Industry Projects
These are pieces of work I've completed at companies. They were done under the standards of the associated company (e.g. code review, internal tools, etc.). In general, I've signed an NDA for these and can't provide anything but a description.

- System for Autonomous Fulfillment Center Mapping for Proteus.
- Low Angle Fiducial Pose Estimation for Proteus. 

## Course Projects
These are directed projects I've completed as part of courses I've taken. I can't link code for these since they're still part of existing courses, but I'll try to show what evidence I can.

*NOTE: Normally one wouldn't display this kind of project at all because it is understood that someone with X engineering or CS degree would have done projects like Y, Z, W, and so on. However, I've realized most people have no idea what a UMich robotics degree entails. Maybe this (non-exhaustive) list of things I've implemented in courses will lessen the confusion. I should also note that much of education is theoretical has more bearing on what I know, than what I've implemented (see the [resources](/resources) page).*

- PoseCNN in PyTorch
- Graph SLAM, Counting Sensor Model Mapping in C++ and Python
- Body Frame PID, Odometry, PF and Occupancy Grid SLAM, and A* Planning on a Differential Drive Robot
- PID Control of a Ballbot
- RRT and URDF-based Forward and Inverse Kinematics

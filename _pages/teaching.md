This is the list of instructional and course development roles I've worked in for robotics courses at Umich. I care a lot about teaching -- especially Michigan's undergraduate program in robotics, which I was one of the first two students to graduate from. I've been very fortunate to meet and work under some inspiring educators (and roboticists) in the Lab for Progress. In particular, [Prof. Odest Chadwicke Jenkins](ocj.name), [Prof. Jana Pavlasek](janapavlasek.com), and [Anthony Opipari](topipari.com) have enabled me and inspired me to work on teaching. Hopefully this page is evidence that I care.

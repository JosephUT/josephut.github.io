*If you're considering hiring me for a robotics job, this page is for you.*

I'm roboticist and software engineer looking for positions developing and deploying state of the art robotic systems. I'm particularly interested in autonomous vehicles (ground, UAV, UUV), and humanoids.  

I have a versatile background across classically studied problems in robotics, including SLAM, perception, motion planning, control, and manipulation, as well as research experience across four robotics labs at Umich, and extensive knowledge of recent methods. I am a software engineer by trade, with production-level development experience at [Amazon Robotics](https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/amazon-robotics) and a deep understanding of relevant computational techniques including middleware implementation, and deep learning inference optimization and deployment on embedded Linux platforms.

Some of the roles I see myself most suited for are listed below.
 - Collaborating with scientists to integrate foundation models with SLAM, perception, planning, and control.
 - Developing planning and control software as a motion planning engineer or GNC engineer.
 - Developing SLAM and perception software in collaboration with a downstream planning team.
 - Developing core robotics libraries and infrastructure to be used across multiple teams and platforms.

I am versed in robotic system design approaches from both control theory and end-to-end deep learning, which I see as the two extremes of robotics. On the model-based side, I am capable in modeling, identification, observer design, controller design, and verifiction, and I am a dedicated user of [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/). On the learning-based side, I am capable with simulation, data collection, model design, training, inference optimization, and deployment, and I am a user of [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

Additionally, I have multiple years of experience developing and teaching system-level robotics courses for Umich Juniors and Freshmen which has allowed me to develop skills in rigorous test design and clear technical communication.

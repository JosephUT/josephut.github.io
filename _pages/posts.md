I spend a lot of time learning stuff on my own. Most of it just ends of floating around in my head and distracting me during the day. Sometimes I think it makes me an angry person. It's not the sort of stuff you can just start a conversation about either, and it really does just bounce around in there. So I try to write down things I'm thinking about a lot, which are almost always something to do with robotics or software, and are frequently also about teaching. Hopefully people passing by find these posts helpful or interesting, or at least vaguely amusing. Either way, it helps get the ideas out of my head.

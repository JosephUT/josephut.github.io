This is where I try to keep links to resources I've found useful while studying robotics. I'm more concerned with developing a wholistic understanding than most. I try to prioritize filling in and refining my knowledge both across the literal robotic system and across the continuum of perspectives that converge on robotics from adjacent fields. 

Mostly they are open source courses, textbooks, tutorials, articles, and GitHub repositories. When possible I try to link freely available content, but if something isn't linked and you're at a university, you can probably get it from the library. That's where I will have gotten it.
